# 4-Real-Estate
4 Real Estate Website

# Description
With this project, we created a real-estate listing website. When you go to the website, you are presented with seeded listings from our sql database. You have an option, via a button on the top, to login or create an account so you can create a new listing. You are routed to a Login/Create account page. You enter your email and password and either submit to login or submit to create the account. You are then routed to the listing submission page. Once you enter all of your information, you are routed back to the Home Page and your listing will then be listed at the bottom of the seeded list.
There is also conditional logic to have the Login button appear on the header when not logged in, or the logout and add listing buttons appear when already logged in.
We also used Cloudinary to be able to add the picture of your house and store it.
